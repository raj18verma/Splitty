# SPLITTY (Split it wisely among your friends)

SPLITTY is a bill splitting calculator that helps you manage expenses with your friends efficiently. Easily keep track of who owes whom and ensure that bills are split fairly among all parties.

## Features

- **Cool Looking Interface:** Enjoy a sleek and user-friendly design that makes bill splitting a breeze.
- **Add New Friends:** Easily add new friends to your list with their name and image.
- **Expense Tracking:** View the total amount you owe to your friends or the amount your friends owe to you.
- **Friend Deletion:** Delete a friend from your list if they are no longer part of the expense sharing group.
- **Split Bills:** Split a bill among friends, specifying who paid the bill, and the app will calculate each person's share.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **HTML:** For structuring the web page.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.
- **JavaScript:** For application logic.
- **Pravatar.cc:** For generating random user images.
- **Crypto:** For generating unique IDs for friends.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
